# Weather
This Python program utilizes the Streamlit framework and OpenWeatherMap API to create a dynamic weather application capable 
of fetching real-time weather data for a specified city. The application allows users to view temperature information in 
either Celsius or Fahrenheit and provides weather descriptions in both English and German languages. By integrating the 
Transformers library, the program offers text translation functionality, enhancing the user experience by providing weather 
information in multiple languages.

# Weather
This Python program leverages the Streamlit framework and OpenWeatherMap API to create a dynamic weather application that 
fetches real-time weather data for a specified city. Users can conveniently view temperature information in Celsius or Fahrenheit 
and access weather descriptions in English or German, facilitated by the integration of the Transformers library for text translation. 
The application further presents the current wind speed in miles per hour and offers descriptive weather conditions based 
on temperature ranges, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly weather report within the application interface.
